      <h2>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Transforms</h3>
      <p>
        The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale,
        and/or skew any element on the page. While some of these effects were
        possible using previously existing CSS features (such as translating
        with relative and absolute positioning), CSS3 gives you unprecedented
        control over many more aspects of the element’s appearance. <br />

        We can manipulate an element’s appearance using transform functions. The
        value of the transform property is one or more transform functions
        (separated by spaces) that will be applied in the order they’re
        provided. In this book, we’ll cover all the two-dimensional transform
        functions. All modern browsers, starting with IE10 and Android 3, also
        support the transformation of elements in 3D space, but 3D transforms
        are beyond the scope of this book.
      </p>
      <h4>Translation</h4>
      <p>
        Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or
        down. These functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative;
        when declaring top and left, moving elements up and down or left and
        right along the x and y axes. When you employ a translation function,
        you’re moving elements without impacting the flow of the document.
        Unlike position: relative, which allows you to position an element
        either against its current position or against a parent or other
        ancestor, a translated element can only be moved relative to its current
        position.

        <br />

        The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from
        the top:
      </p>
      <p>transform: translate(45px, -45px);</p>
      <h5>Note: Transforms and Older Browsers</h5>
      <p>
        Transforms require vendor prefixing for IE9, Android up to 4.4.3, iOS8,
        and Blackberry 10. To make the aforementioned code work in IE9 and older
        mobile WebKit browsers, you would include the following: <br />
        -webkit-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* iOS8, Android <br />
        ↵4.4.3, BB10 */ <br />
        -ms-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* IE9 only */ <br />
        transform: translate(45px,-45px); <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can
        use the translatex or translatey functions respectively. To move 45px to
        the right along the x axis, include: <br />
        transform: translateX(45px); <br />
        To move up along the y axis by 30px, include: <br />
        transform: translateY(-30px); <br />
      </p>

      <h4>Scaling</h4>
      <p>
        The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors
        horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be
        used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or
        pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio. For example,
        scale(1) would leave the element the same size, scale(2) would double
        its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them, and so on. Providing
        different values will distort the element, as you’d expect:
        <br />
        transform: scale(1.5, 0.25);
        <br />
        As with translate, you can also use the scaleX(x) or scaleY(y)
        functions. These functions will scale only the horizontal dimensions or
        only the vertical dimensions respectively.
        <br />
        A scaled element will grow outwards from or shrink inwards towards its
        center; in other words, the element’s center will stay in the same place
        as its dimensions change. To change this default behavior, you can
        include the transform-origin property, which we’ll be covering a bit
        later.
      </p>

      <h4>Rotation</h4>
      <p>
        The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a
        specified angle value. As with scale, by default the point of origin is
        the element’s center. Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with
        positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwise.
        In addition to degrees, values can be provided in grads, radians, or
        turns, but we’ll just be sticking with degrees.
      </p>

      <h4>Skew</h4>
      <p>
        The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d
        expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the
        skew on the y axis. If the second parameter is omitted, the skew will
        only occur on the x axis: <br />
        transform: skew(15deg, 4deg);
      </p>

      <h3>Transitions</h3>
      <p>
        Animation has certainly been possible for some time with JavaScript, but
        native CSS transitions generally require less client-side processing, so
        they’ll usually appear smoother. On mobile devices with limited
        computing power, this can be a lifesaver.<br />
        <br />
        As much fun as it’s been to have a feature work in IE9, it’s time to
        again leave that browser behind. IE10 and all other browsers support CSS
        transitions, and transitions are UI enhancements, and fail accessibly,
        so we need not worry about archaic IE browsers.<br />
        <br />
        Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time,
        essentially providing simple animations. For example, if a link changes
        color on hover, you can have it gradually fade from one color to the
        other instead of a sudden change. They’re both transitions, but with the
        CSS transition property the color transition can be gradual. If the
        browser lacks support for transitions, the change will be immediate
        instead of gradual, which is fine and accessible.<br />
        <br />
        We can animate any of the transforms we’ve just seen, so that our pages
        feel more dynamic.<br />
        <br />
        CSS transitions are declared along with the regular styles on an
        element. Whenever the target properties change, the browser will apply
        the transition making the change gradual. Often the change will be due
        to different styles applied to a hover state; however, transitions will
        work equally well if the property in question is changed by adding a
        class, or otherwise using JavaScript to change state. This is
        significant: rather than writing out an animation in JavaScript, you can
        simply switch a property value and rely on the browser to do all the
        heavy lifting.
      </p>

      <p>Here are the steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Declare the original state of the element in the default style
          declaration.
        </li>
        <li>
          Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a
          :hover state.
        </li>
        <li>
          Include the transition functions in your default style declaration
          using the transition properties, including: transition-property,
          transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.
          We’ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the
        element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being
        the default.
      </p>
      <h4>The transition-duration Property</h4>
      <p>
        The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take:
        the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the
        transitioned state. You can specify this either in seconds (s) or
        milliseconds (ms). We’d like our animation to be fairly quick, so we’ll
        specify 0.2 seconds (0.2s), or 200 milliseconds (200ms):
      </p>

      <h4>The transition-timing-function Property</h4>
      <p>
        The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the
        transition in even more granular detail. Do you want your animation to
        start off slow and become faster, start off fast and end slower, advance
        at an even keel, or some other variation? <br />

        The most common timing functions include the key terms ease, linear,
        ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out. The default ease has a slow start,
        then it speeds up, and ends slowly. ease-in-out is similar to ease, but
        accelerates more sharply at the beginning. linear creates a transition
        that animates at a constant speed. ease-in creates a transition that is
        slow to start but gains speed, then stops abruptly. The opposite,
        ease-out, starts at full speed, then slows progressively as it reaches
        the conclusion of the transition. The best way to familiarize yourself
        with them is to play around and try them all. Most often, one will just
        feel right for the effect you’re aiming to create. It’s helpful to set a
        relatively long transition-duration when testing timing functions—if
        it’s too fast, you may not be able to tell the difference.
      </p>

      <h4>The transition-delay Property</h4>
      <p>
        Finally, by using the transition-delay property, it’s possible to
        introduce a delay before the transition begins. Normally a transition
        begins immediately, so the default is 0. Include the number of
        milliseconds (ms) or seconds (s) to delay the transition. We don’t want
        our transition to start immediately, because that might be a bad user
        experience if the user accidentally mouses through our ad on the way
        from one part of the document to the next. A 50ms delay is enough time
        to wait to be sure they are intentionally hovering over our
        advertisement: <br />
        <br />
        -webkit-transition-delay: 50ms; transition-delay: 50ms;
      </p>

      <h3>Animations</h3>
      <p>
        Transitions animate elements over time; however, they’re limited in what
        they can do. You can define starting and ending states, but there’s no
        fine-grained control over any intermediate states. CSS animations,
        unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via
        keyframes. <br />
        <br />
        If you’ve ever worked with Flash, you’re likely very familiar with the
        concept of keyframes; if not, don’t worry, it’s fairly straightforward.
        A keyframe is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any
        smooth transition. With CSS transitions, we’re essentially limited to
        defining a first and a last keyframe. CSS animations allow us to add any
        number of keyframes in between, to guide our animation in more complex
        ways. <br />
        <br />
        All modern browsers support CSS animation, starting with IE10, though we
        still require the -webkit- prefix in iOS8, Android 4.4.3, and BlackBerry
        10. IE10 is unprefixed. Firefox 16, Chrome 39, and Opera 26 dropped
        their need for a prefix for CSS animations. <br />
        <br />
        The lack of powerful processors on many mobile devices makes CSS
        animations a great alternative to weighty, CPU-intensive JavaScript
        animation. Generally, it is best to use CSS for simple-state changes in
        a mobile environment. But it’s still better to employ JavaScript for
        intricate, stateful UIs, and when you do, you’ll likely want to use a
        JavaScript animation library to help with manageability and performance.
        <br />
        <br />
        We do have a subtle animation in our Herald, so we’ll use CSS for our
        animations.
      </p>

      <h4>Keyframes</h4>
      <p>
        To animate an element in CSS, you first create a named animation, then
        attach it to an element in that element’s property declaration block.
        Animations in themselves don’t do anything; in order to animate an
        element, you’ll need to associate the animation with that element.
        <br />
        <br />
        To create an animation, use the @keyframes rule for IE10+ and FF16+.
        Include @-webkit-keyframes for all WebKit implementations followed by a
        name of your choosing, which will serve as the identifier for the
        animation. Then, you can specify your keyframes. <br />
        <br />
        For an animation called myAnimation, the @keyframes rule would look like
        this: <br />
        <br />

        @-webkit-keyframes myAnimation { <br />
        /* put animation keyframes here */ <br />
        } <br />
        @keyframes myAnimation { <br />
        /* put animation keyframes here */ <br />
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        function wait(message, callback, seconds){<br />
        setTimeout(callback,seconds * 1000);<br />
        console.log(message);<br />
        }
      </p>
      <p>
         @keyframes moveRight { <br />
            from { <br />
            transform: translateX(-50%); <br />
            } <br />
            to { <br />
            transform: translateX(50%); <br />
            } <br />
        } <br />
        <br />
        @keyframes appearDisappear { <br />
            0%, 100% { <br />
            opacity: 0; <br />
            } <br />
            20%, 80% { <br />
            opacity: 1; <br />
            } <br />
        } <br />
        <br />
        @keyframes bgMove { <br />
            100% { <br />
            background-position: 120% 0; <br />
            } <br />
        }
