      <h2>Client-side form validation</h2>
      <p>
        Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all
        required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. This is
        called client-side form validation, and helps ensure data submitted
        matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls. This
        article leads you through basic concepts and examples of client-side
        form validation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of
        good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the
        user can fix it straight away. If it gets to the server and is then
        rejected, a noticeable delay is caused by a round trip to the server and
        then back to the client-side to tell the user to fix their data.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, client-side validation should not be considered an exhaustive
        security measure! Your apps should always perform security checks on any
        form-submitted data on the server-side as well as the client-side,
        because client-side validation is too easy to bypass, so malicious users
        can still easily send bad data through to your server. Read Website
        security for an idea of what could happen; implementing server-side
        validation is somewhat beyond the scope of this module, but you should
        bear it in mind.
      </p>
      <h3>What is form validation?</h3>
      <p>
        Go to any popular site with a registration form, and you will notice
        that they provide feedback when you don't enter your data in the format
        they are expecting. You'll get messages such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>"This field is required" (You can't leave this field blank).</li>
        <li>
          "Please enter your phone number in the format xxx-xxxx" (A specific
          data format is required for it to be considered valid).
        </li>
        <li>
          "Please enter a valid email address" (the data you entered is not in
          the right format).
        </li>
        <li>
          "Your password needs to be between 8 and 30 characters long and
          contain one uppercase letter, one symbol, and a number." (A very
          specific data format is required for your data).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is called form validation. When you enter data, the browser and/or
        the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format
        and within the constraints set by the application. Validation done in
        the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on
        the server is called server-side validation. In this chapter we are
        focusing on client-side validation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the information is correctly formatted, the application allows the
        data to be submitted to the server and (usually) saved in a database; if
        the information isn't correctly formatted, it gives the user an error
        message explaining what needs to be corrected, and lets them try again.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to make filling out web forms as easy as possible. So why do we
        insist on validating our forms? There are three main reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We want to get the right data, in the right format. Our applications
          won't work properly if our users' data is stored in the wrong format,
          is incorrect, or is omitted altogether.
        </li>
        <li>
          We want to protect our users' data. Forcing our users to enter secure
          passwords makes it easier to protect their account information.
        </li>
        <li>
          We want to protect ourselves. There are many ways that malicious users
          can misuse unprotected forms to damage the application (see Website
          security).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Different types of client-side validation</h3>
      <p>
        There are two different types of client-side validation that you'll
        encounter on the web:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features, which
          we've discussed in many places throughout this module. This validation
          generally doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation
          has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable
          as JavaScript validation.
        </li>
        <li>
          JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is
          completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a
          library).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Using built-in form validation</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most significant features of HTML5 form controls is the
        ability to validate most user data without relying on JavaScript. This
        is done by using validation attributes on form elements. We've seen many
        of these earlier in the course, but to recap:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before
          the form can be submitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of
          textual data (strings)
        </li>
        <li>
          min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical
          input types
        </li>
        <li>
          type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email
          address, or some other specific preset type.
        </li>
        <li>
          pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the
          entered data needs to follow.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If the data entered in a form field follows all of the rules specified
        by the above attributes, it is considered valid. If not, it is
        considered invalid.
      </p>
      <p>When an element is valid, the following things are true:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The element matches the :valid CSS pseudo-class, which lets you apply
          a specific style to valid elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the user tries to send the data, the browser will submit the form,
          provided there is nothing else stopping it from doing so (e.g.,
          JavaScript).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>When an element is invalid, the following things are true:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The element matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-class, and sometimes other
          UI pseudo-classes (e.g., :out-of-range) depending on the error, which
          lets you apply a specific style to invalid elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the user tries to send the data, the browser will block the form
          and display an error message.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>The required attribute</h3>
      <p>
        The simplest HTML5 validation feature is the required attribute. To make
        an input mandatory, add this attribute to the element. When this
        attribute is set, the element matches the :required UI pseudo-class and
        the form won't submit, displaying an error message on submission when
        the input is empty. While empty, the input will also be considered
        invalid, matching the :invalid UI pseudo-class.
      </p>
      <h3>Validating against a regular expression</h3>
      <p>
        Another useful validation feature is the pattern attribute, which
        expects a Regular Expression as its value. A regular expression (regex)
        is a pattern that can be used to match character combinations in text
        strings, so regexps are ideal for form validation and serve a variety of
        other uses in JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regexps are quite complex, and we don't intend to teach you them
        exhaustively in this article. Below are some examples to give you a
        basic idea of how they work.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a — Matches one character that is a (not b, not aa, and so on).</li>
        <li>abc — Matches a, followed by b, followed by c.</li>
        <li>
          ab?c—Matches a, optionally followed by a single b, followed by c. ( ac
          or abc)
        </li>
        <li>
          ab*c—Matches a, optionally followed by any number of bs, followed by
          c. ( ac , abc, abbbbbc, and so on).
        </li>
        <li>a|b — Matches one character that is a or b.</li>
        <li>
          abc|xyz — Matches exactly abc or exactly xyz (but not abcxyz or a or
          y, and so on).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are many more possibilities that we don't cover here. For a
        complete list and many examples, consult our Regular expressions
        documentation.
      </p>
      <h3>Constraining the length of your entries</h3>
      <p>
        You can constrain the character length of all text fields created by
        input tag or text area tag by using the minlength and maxlength
        attributes. A field is invalid if it has a value and that value has
        fewer characters than the minlength value or more than the maxlenth
        value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Browsers often don't let the user type a longer value than expected into
        text fields. A better user experience than just using maxlength is to
        also provide character count feedback in an accessible manner and let
        them edit their content down to size. An example of this is the
        character limit seen on Twitter when Tweeting. Javascript, including
        solutions using maxlength, can be used to provide this.
      </p>

      <h3>Constraining the values of your entries</h3>
      <p>
        For number fields (i.e. <input type="number" />), the min and max
        attributes can be used to provide a range of valid values. If the field
        contains a value outside this range, it will be invalid.
