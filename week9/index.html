      <h2>The Window Object</h2>
      <p>
        Every JavaScript environment has a global object. Any variables that are
        created in the global scope are actually properties of this object, and
        any functions are methods of it. In a browser environment the global
        object is the window object, which represents the browser window that
        contains a web page.
      </p>
      <p>In this chapter, we’ll cover these topics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Browser Object Model</li>

        <h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
        <p>
          The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of
          properties and methods that contain information about the browser and
          computer screen. For example, we can find out which browser is being
          used to view a page (though, this method is unreliable). We can also
          find out the dimensions of the screen it is viewed on, and which pages
          have been visited before the current page. It can also be used for the
          rather dubious practice of creating pop-up windows, if you’re into
          annoying your users.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There is no official standard for the BOM, although there are a number
          of properties and methods that are supported by all the major
          browsers, making a sort of de facto standard. These properties and
          methods are made available through the window object. Every browser
          window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object.
        </p>
        <p>The BOM Only Makes Sense in a Browser Environment</p>
        <p>
          Remember that JavaScript can be run in different environments. The BOM
          only makes sense in a browser environment. This means that other
          environments (such as Node.js) probably won’t have a window object,
          although they will still have a global object; for example, Node.js
          has an object called global.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you don’t know the name of the global object, you can also refer to
          it using the keyword this in the global scope. The following code
          provides a quick way of assigning the variable global to the global
          object:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          // from within the global scope <br />
          const global = this;
        </p>
        <div>
          <h4>Going Global</h4>
          <p>
            All the way back in Chapter 2, we introduced the concept of global
            variables. These are variables that are created without using the
            const, let or var keywords. Global variables can be accessed in all
            parts of the program.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Global variables are actual properties of a global object. In a
            browser environment, the global object is the window object. This
            means that any global variable created is actually a property of the
            window object, as can be seen in the example below:
          </p>
          <p>
            x = 6; // global variable created<br />
            << 6<br />
            <br />
            window.x // same variable can be accessed as a property of the
            window object<br />
            << 6<br />
            <br />
            // both variables are exactly the same<br />
            window.x === x;<br />
            << true
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Dialogs</h4>
          <p>
            In Chapter 1, we introduced three functions that produced dialogs in
            the browsers: alert(), confirm() and prompt(). These are not part of
            the ECMAScript standard, although all major browsers support them as
            methods of the window object.
          </p>
          <p>
            The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program
            and display a message in a dialog box. The message is provided as an
            argument to the method, and undefined is always returned:
          </p>
          <p>
            The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program
            and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as
            an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel. It returns the
            boolean values of true if the user clicks OK, and false if the user
            clicks Cancel:
          </p>
          <p>
            The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program.
            It displays a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument,
            as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text. This
            text is then returned as a string when the user clicks OK. If the
            user clicks Cancel, null is returned:
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Browser Information</h3>
        <p>
          The window object has a number of properties and methods that provide
          information about the user’s browser.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h4>Which Browser?</h4>
          <p>
            The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference
            to the Navigator object. The Navigator object contains information
            about the browser being used. Its userAgent property will return
            information about the browser and operating system being used. For
            example, if I run the following line of code, it shows that I am
            using Safari version 10 on Mac OS:
          </p>
          <p>
            window.navigator.userAgent <br />
            << "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_3)
            AppleWebKit/602.4.8 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/10.0.3
            Safari/602.4.8"
          </p>
          <p>
            Don’t rely on this information though, as it can be modified by a
            user to masquerade as a different browser. It can also be difficult
            to make any sense of the string returned, because all browsers
            pretend to be others to some degree. For example, every browser will
            include the string “Mozilla” in its userAgent property, for reasons
            of legacy Netscape compatibility. The userAgent property has been
            deprecated from the official specification, but it remains well
            supported in all major browsers.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Location, Location, Location</h4>
          <p>
            The window.location property is an object that contains information
            about the URL of the current page. It contains a number of
            properties that provide information about different fragments of the
            URL.<br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The href property returns the full URL as a string:<br />
            <br />
            window.location.href <br />
            <<
            "https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja"
          </p>
          <p>
            The protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used
            (such as http, https, pop2, ftp etc.). Note that there is a colon
            (:) at the end:<br />
            <br />
            window.location.protocol <br />
            << "https:"
          </p>
          <p>
            The host property returns a string describing the domain of the
            current URL and the port number (this is often omitted if the
            default port 80 is used):<br />
            <br />
            window.location.host
            <br />
            << << "www.sitepoint.com"
          </p>
          <p>
            The hostname property returns a string describing the domain of the
            current URL:<br />
            <br />
            window.location.hostname <br />
            << "www.sitepoint.com"
          </p>
          <p>
            The port property returns a string describing the port number,
            although it will return an empty string if the port is not
            explicitly stated in the URL:<br />
            <br />
            window.location.port <br />
            << ""
          </p>
          <p>
            The pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the
            domain:<br />
            <br />
            window.location.pathname <br />
            << "/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja"
          </p>
          <p>
            The search property returns a string that starts with a “?” followed
            by the query string parameters. It returns an empty string if there
            are no query string parameters. This is what I get when I search for
            “JavaScript” on SitePoint:<br />
            <br />
            window.location.search <br />
            << "?q=javascript&limit=24&offset=0&page=1&
            content_types[]=All&slugs[]=all&states[]=available&order="
          </p>
          <p>
            The hash property returns a string that starts with a “#” followed by the fragment identifier. It returns an empty string if there is no fragment identifier:<br />
            <br />
            window.location.hash <br />
            << ""
          </p>
          <p>
            The origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated from. This property is read-only, so cannot be changed:<br />
            <br />
            window.location.origin <br />
            << "https://www.sitepoint.com"
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page. If it’s given a parameter of true, it will force the browser to reload the page from the server, instead of using a cached page.</li>
            <li>The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter, for example:</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            window.location.assign('https://www.sitepoint.com/')<br />
            <br />
            <ul>
               <li>The replace() method is almost the same as the assign() method, except the current page will not be stored in the session history, so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back button.</li>
               <li>The toString() method returns a string containing the whole URL:</li>
             </ul>
             window.location.toString(); <br />
             << "https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript/"
          </p>
        </div>
