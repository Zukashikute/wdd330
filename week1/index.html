      <p>
        The data is not deleted when the browser is closed, and are available
        for future sessions.

      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>
        In the real world experience is it beneficial for someone's website to
        use localStorage than using database? I just haven't seen a website that
        uses localStorage. Most websites use database.
