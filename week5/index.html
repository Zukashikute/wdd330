      <h3>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h3>
      <p>
        Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are
        usually caused by one of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices
          with which the program is interacting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty
          logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.
        </li>
        <li>
          User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program
          is unable to handle.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Exceptions</h4>
      <p>
        An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be
        used by the program to deal with the error. For example, trying to call
        a method that is nonexistent will result in a reference error that
        raises an exception, as you can see in the example below when we try to
        call the mythical unicorn() function:
      </p>
      <p>
        unicorn(); <br />
        ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined
      </p>

      <h4>Exception Handling</h4>
      <p>
        When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message.
        This is ideal in development as it allows us to identify and fix errors.
        In production, however, it will appear as if the program has crashed,
        which does not reflect well on a ninja programmer.
        <br />
        It is possible to handle exceptions gracefully by catching the error.
        Any errors can be hidden from users, but still identified. We can then
        deal with the error appropriately ― perhaps even ignore it ― and keep
        the program running.

      <h4>Test-driven Development</h4>
      <p>
        Test-driven development (TDD) is the process of writing tests before any
        actual code. Obviously these tests will initially fail, because there is
        no code to test. The next step is to write some code to make the tests
        pass. After this, the code is refactored to make it faster, more
        readable, and remove any repetition. The code is continually tested at
        each stage to make sure it continues to work. This process should be
        followed in small piecemeal chunks every time a new feature is
        implemented, resulting in the following workflow:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>
        <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
        <li>Refactor the code</li>
        <li>Test refactored code</li>
        <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This is often referred to as the “red-green-refactor” cycle of TDD, as
        failing tests usually show up as red, and tests that pass show as green.
      </p>
      <p>
        Test-driven development is considered to be best practice, but in
        reality you'll find most developers tend to be more pragmatic when it
        comes to writing tests. The TDD mindset can be hard to always use, and
        at the end of the day, any tests are better than no tests at all. In
        fact, this post by David Heinemeier Hansson shows that even the very
        best coders don't always use TDD, and make no apologies for not doing
        so. We cover an example in this chapter, but won't be using it for the
        most of the examples in the rest of the book as it would make it far too
        long!
