      <h3>The DOM</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The document.getElementById(), document.getElementsByClassName(),
          document.getElementsByTagNames() and document.querySelector() can be
          used to access elements on a page.
        </li>
        <li>
          The parentNode(), previousSibling(), nextSibling(), childNodes() and
          children() methods can be used to navigate around the DOM tree.
        </li>
        <li>
          An element’s attributes can be accessed using the getAttribute()
          method, and updated using the setAttribute() method.
        </li>
        <li>
          The createElement() and createTextNode() methods can be used to create
          dynamic markup on the fly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Markup can be added to the page using the appendChild() and
          insertBefore() methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          Elements can be replaced using the replaceChild() method, and removed
          using the removeChild() method.
        </li>
        <li>
          The innerHTML property can be used to insert raw HTML directly into
          the DOM.
        </li>
        <li>
          The CSS properties of an element can be changed by accessing the style
          property.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Events</h3>

      <h4>Type of Events</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Mouse Events</li>
        <p>
          We have already seen the click event that occurs when a mouse button
          is clicked. There are also the mousedown and mouseup events. These
          both occur before a click event is fired.
        </p>
        <li>Keyboard Events</li>
        <p>
          Three events that occur when a user presses a key are: keydown,
          keypress and keyup. When a user presses a key, the events occur in
          that order. They are not tied to any particular key, although the
          information about which key was pressed is a property of the event
          object. <br />

          The keydown event occurs when a key is pressed and will continue to
          occur if the key is held down. <br />

          The keypress event occurs after a keydown event but before a keyup
          event. The keypress event only occurs for keys that produce character
          input (plus the 'Delete' key). This means that it’s the most reliable
          way to find out the character that was pressed on the keyboard. <br />

          The keyup event occurs when a key is released. <br />

          To understand the differences in these events, it is important to
          distinguish between a physical key on the keyboard and a character
          that appears on the screen. The keydown event is the action of
          pressing a key, whereas the keypress event is the action of a
          character being typed on the screen.
        </p>
        <li>Touch Events</li>
        <p>
          Many modern devices now support touch events. These are used on
          smartphones and tablets, as well as touch-screen monitors, satellite
          navigators and trackpads. Touch events are usually made with a finger,
          but can also be by stylus or another part of the body. There are a
          number of touch events that cover many types of touch interactions.
          <br />

          It’s important to support mouse events as well as touch events, so
          non-touch devices are also supported. With so many different devices
          these days, you can’t rely on users using just touch or a mouse. In
          fact, some devices, such as touchscreen laptops, support both mouse
          and touch interactions. <br />

          The touch start event occurs when a user initially touches the
          surface.
          <br />

          The touch end event occurs when a user stops touching the surface:
          <br />
          The touch move event occurs after a user has touched the screen then
          moves around without leaving. It will continue to occur as long as the
          user is still touching the screen, even if they leave the element to
          which the event listener is attached. <br />

          The touch enter event occurs when a user has already started touching
          the surface, but then passes over the element to which the event
          listener is attached. <br />

          The touch leave event occurs when the user is still touching the
          surface, but leaves the element to which the event listener is
          attached. <br />

          The touch cancel event occurs when a touch event is interrupted, such
          as a user’s finger moving outside the document window, or too many
          fingers being used at once. A pop-up dialog will also cancel a touch
          event.
